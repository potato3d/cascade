Prototype of CasCADe 4D visualization system for virtual construction planning

This repository implements an early research prototype of the system described in the article [CasCADe: A Novel 4D Visualization System for Virtual Construction Planning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019847)

# Description

The system implements innovative visualizations over a 3D CAD model that make evident a construction schedule's task sequencing and spatio-temporal simultaneity. This unique framework enables the combination of diverse analytical features to create an information-rich analysis environment. The system helps diagnose schedule uncertainties, identified work-space conflicts and analyze other constructability issues.

Please check the paper referenced above for more details.

# Results

These are some examples of the implemented visualization:
